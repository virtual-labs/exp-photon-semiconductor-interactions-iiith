"question": "1. In semiconductors, what condition must a photon satisfy to generate an electron-hole pair?",
"answers": {
"a": "hν < Eg",
"b": "hν = Eg",
"c": "hν ≥ Eg",
"d": "hν << Eg"
},
"explanations": {
"a": "Incorrect. Photons with less energy than Eg cannot excite electrons.",
"b": "Incorrect. Exactly Eg works but not always sufficient; we require hν ≥ Eg.",
"c": "Correct. Photon energy must be greater than or equal to the bandgap energy.",
"d": "Incorrect. Too little energy results in no carrier excitation."
},
"correctAnswer": "c",
"difficulty": "beginner"
},
{
"question": "2. Which type of material is more efficient for light emission in LEDs?",
"answers": {
"a": "Indirect bandgap materials like Si",
"b": "Direct bandgap materials like GaAs",
"c": "Wide-bandgap insulators",
"d": "Any material, bandgap does not matter"
},
"explanations": {
"a": "Incorrect. Indirect materials lose energy to phonons.",
"b": "Correct. Direct bandgap materials allow efficient radiative recombination.",
"c": "Incorrect. Insulators are not suitable for carrier injection.",
"d": "Incorrect. Bandgap type critically affects light emission."

{
"question": "3. Fluorescence differs from phosphorescence mainly in:",
"answers": {
"a": "Photon wavelength",
"b": "Carrier lifetime after excitation",
"c": "Photon energy source",
"d": "Bandgap size"
},
"explanations": {
"a": "Incorrect. Both can emit similar wavelengths.",
"b": "Correct. Fluorescence has short lifetimes (~ns), phosphorescence has longer lifetimes (~ms to s).",
"c": "Incorrect. Both depend on absorbed photons.",
"d": "Incorrect. Bandgap size doesn't distinguish them."

{
"question": "4. For a semiconductor with Eg = 1.9 eV, find the maximum wavelength λmax of photons that can generate e-h pairs. Use h = 6.626×10⁻³⁴ J·s, c = 3×10⁸ m/s, q = 1.6×10⁻¹⁹ C.",
"answers": {
"a": "520 nm",
"b": "653 nm",
"c": "730 nm",
"d": "820 nm"
},
"explanations": {
"a": "Incorrect. Miscalculated using Eg incorrectly.",
"b": "Correct. λmax = hc/(Eg·q) ≈ (6.626e-34×3e8)/(1.9×1.6e-19) ≈ 653 nm.",
"c": "Incorrect. Too large for given Eg.",
"d": "Incorrect. Far too large; violates energy relation."

"correctAnswer": "b",
"difficulty": "intermediate"
},
{
"question": "5. The absorption coefficient α of a direct bandgap semiconductor near the band edge follows which relation?",
"answers": {
"a": "α ∝ (hν - Eg)²",
"b": "α ∝ √(hν - Eg)",
"c": "α ∝ (hν)²",
"d": "α ∝ exp(hν)"
},
"explanations": {
"a": "Incorrect. That is the behavior for indirect bandgap materials.",
"b": "Correct. For direct bandgap semiconductors, α ∝ √(hν - Eg).",
"c": "Incorrect. Square dependence is not observed.",
"d": "Incorrect. Exponential relation is unrelated here."

"correctAnswer": "b",
"difficulty": "intermediate"

{
"question": "6. In a semiconductor laser, population inversion is achieved when:",
"answers": {
"a": "N2 < N1",
"b": "N2 = N1",
"c": "N2 > N1",
"d": "Carrier lifetime = 0"
},
"explanations": {
"a": "Incorrect. N2 < N1 implies no lasing occurs.",
"b": "Incorrect. Equal populations do not generate gain.",
"c": "Correct. Stimulated emission dominates only when the upper level population exceeds the lower level.",
"d": "Incorrect. Zero lifetime prevents emission entirely."
},
"correctAnswer": "c",
"difficulty": "intermediate"
},
{
"question": "7. A semiconductor has Eg = 2.0 eV. If a photon of λ = 700 nm strikes it, will it create an e-h pair? Use hc = 1240 eV·nm.",
"answers": {
"a": "Yes, because photon energy = 2.5 eV",
"b": "No, because photon energy = 1.77 eV",
"c": "Yes, because photon energy = 1.5 eV",
"d": "Cannot determine without material type"
},
"explanations": {
"a": "Incorrect. Energy calculation mismatch.",
"b": "Correct. E = hc/λ ≈ 1240/700 ≈ 1.77 eV, which is < Eg, so no absorption occurs.",
"c": "Incorrect. Wrong energy computation.",
"d": "Incorrect. Material type irrelevant; only Eg vs. E matters."
},
"correctAnswer": "b",
"difficulty": "advanced"
},
{
"question": "8. The rate of spontaneous emission Rsp in a direct bandgap semiconductor is proportional to:",
"answers": {
"a": "n²",
"b": "n",
"c": "Eg",
"d": "1/Eg"
},
"explanations": {
"a": "Correct. Rsp ∝ n² since recombination depends on both electron and hole densities.",
"b": "Incorrect. Single carrier density does not define recombination fully.",
"c": "Incorrect. Energy gap affects wavelength, not Rsp directly.",
"d": "Incorrect. Inverse Eg relation doesn't hold."
},
"correctAnswer": "a",
"difficulty": "advanced"
},
{
"question": "9. In stimulated emission, the emitted photon has:",
"answers": {
"a": "Higher energy than incident photon",
"b": "Same energy, phase, and direction as incident photon",
"c": "Lower energy than incident photon",
"d": "Random phase and direction"
},
"explanations": {
"a": "Incorrect. Energy is not amplified per photon.",
"b": "Correct. Stimulated emission produces photons coherent in energy, phase, and direction.",
"c": "Incorrect. Photon energy remains constant.",
"d": "Incorrect. Randomness applies to spontaneous emission, not stimulated."
