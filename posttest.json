    {
      "question": "1. In a direct bandgap semiconductor, photon emission is more efficient because:",
      "options": {
        "a": "Electron momentum changes significantly",
        "b": "No phonon assistance is needed for recombination",
        "c": "Absorption coefficient is independent of energy",
        "d": "Bandgap energy is zero"
      },
      "answer": "b",
      "explanation": "In direct bandgap materials, electrons directly recombine with holes without requiring phonon assistance, making photon emission more efficient."
    },
    {
      "question": "2. Which phenomenon is responsible for the delayed light emission in phosphorescence?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Fast radiative recombination",
        "b": "Trapping of carriers in metastable states",
        "c": "Direct transition across the bandgap",
        "d": "Spontaneous stimulated emission"
      },
      "answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Phosphorescence occurs when carriers get trapped in metastable states, causing delayed photon emission compared to fluorescence."
    },
    {
      "question": "3. Which property determines whether a semiconductor is suitable for LED applications?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Indirect bandgap and high resistivity",
        "b": "Direct bandgap and high radiative efficiency",
        "c": "Low mobility of charge carriers",
        "d": "Very wide bandgap"
      },
      "answer": "b",
      "explanation": "LEDs require direct bandgap materials because they exhibit efficient radiative recombination, resulting in bright light emission."

    {
      "question": "4. If the absorption coefficient α of a material sharply increases when the incident photon energy exceeds Eg, this indicates:",
      "options": {
        "a": "The material has a direct bandgap",
        "b": "The material has an indirect bandgap",
        "c": "Photon energy is less than the Fermi energy",
        "d": "Carrier mobility is constant"
      },
      "answer": "a",
      "explanation": "For direct bandgap semiconductors, the absorption coefficient rises quickly when photon energy surpasses Eg, as transitions require no phonon assistance."

    {
      "question": "5. Fluorescence differs from stimulated emission because:",
      "options": {
        "a": "Fluorescence is instantaneous and incoherent",
        "b": "Fluorescence requires population inversion",
        "c": "Stimulated emission emits random photons",
        "d": "Stimulated emission occurs without energy input"
      },
      "answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Fluorescence occurs spontaneously and produces incoherent light, whereas stimulated emission is triggered and produces coherent photons."

      "question": "6. The peak wavelength (λ) emitted by a semiconductor LED is primarily determined by:",
      "options": {
        "a": "Carrier mobility",
        "b": "Doping concentration",
        "c": "Bandgap energy Eg",
        "d": "Lattice constant"
      },
      "answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The emitted photon energy depends on the bandgap: λ ≈ hc/Eg. A larger Eg gives a shorter emission wavelength."
    },
    {
      "question": "7. A semiconductor has Eg = 1.8 eV. Calculate the wavelength of the emitted photons during spontaneous emission.",
      "options": {
        "a": "689 nm",
        "b": "550 nm",
        "c": "1032 nm",
        "d": "450 nm"
      },
      "answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Using E = hc/λ → λ = 1240/E. For Eg = 1.8 eV, λ = 1240/1.8 ≈ 689 nm, which lies in the red region."
    },
    {
      "question": "8. In a laser diode, population inversion is necessary because:",
      "options": {
        "a": "It minimizes non-radiative recombination",
        "b": "It ensures stimulated emission dominates over absorption",
        "c": "It lowers the threshold current for LEDs",
        "d": "It increases phonon scattering"
      },
      "answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Population inversion means more carriers are in excited states than in ground states, allowing stimulated emission to dominate and enabling lasing."

      "question": "9. For a semiconductor with an indirect bandgap, efficient photon emission requires:",
      "options": {
        "a": "Only electron-hole recombination",
